# Red Wine Data Analysis using R
In this project, I have analyzed the Red Wine Dataset and tried to understand which variables are responsible for the quality of the wine.  
First I have tried to get a feel of the variables on their own and then I have tried to find out the correlation between them and the Wine Quality with other factors thrown in.  
Finally I  have created a linear model to predict the outcome of a test set data.
